TASK: Group related risk findings that refer to the same underlying incident.
GUIDELINES:
1. Findings refer to SAME INCIDENT if they share:
   - Same company + same incident type + similar timeframe
   - Same root cause + same impact type + same affected scope
   
2. For each incident group:
   - Select PRIMARY source (most credible/complete information)
   - List SUPPORTING sources (additional coverage of same incident)
   - Create consolidated incident description
   
3. Only group findings with HIGH confidence (>0.8)
4. When uncertain, keep findings separate
5. Look for keywords indicating same incident: specific dates, incident IDs, similar impact descriptions
